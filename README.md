# Developer Tools for GNUstep

This repository contains various developer tools for GNUstep. Currently, it includes the `AssetCompiler`, which compiles `.xcassets` into a format usable by GNUstep applications, and `EJCAsset`, which allows GNUstep applications to use assets which have been compiled by `AssetCompiler`.

These tools were developed to help port GitUp to Linux/GNUstep.
